# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
V. Isualize has asked Omar and I to use our python skills and knowlege of Pandas and Matplotlib to create a summary and graph of the ride-sharing data. In using Pandas and Matplotlib, we have created a multi line graph that visualizes the toal weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
![TABLE](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/TABLE.png)
Difference in ride-sharing data among the different city types:
- Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Ride at $34.62
- Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Driver at $55.49
- Urban Cities have the highest amount of Total Rides at 1,625
- Urban Cities have the highest amount of Total Fares at $39,854.39
- Urban Cities have the most amount of Total Drivers at 2,405, almost 5x more than Suburban Cities and 30x more than Rural Cities
- Suburban Cities have 6x more Total Drivers than Rural Cities

## Summary
Based on the results from the ride-sharing data set, we have concluded that an increase Total Drivers may also increase Total Fares but decrease Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. This can we seen in the summary table; although Rural and Suburban Cities have higher Average Fare per Ride and Driver, with less Total Fares - whereas Urban Cities have lower Average Fare per Ride and Driver, but a higher Total Fares.
- Create more jobs for Total Drivers to increase, so that Total Fares can increase.
- Increase Average Fare per Ride and Driver in Urban Cities by increasing Fare Prices due to demand.
- Cater to Rural and Suburban Drivers and Riders by increasing Total Drivers who are open to longer distanced rides, as we can see that the two city types take longer distance rides.
